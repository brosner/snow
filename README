Usage
=====

There are multiple ways to configure bosnowsgi.

Using a configuration file
--------------------------

The power of bosnowsgi comes in the ability to configure multiple WSGI process
instances with one configuration file. It is currently required to have a
``.bosnowsgirc`` file in your home directory. Go ahead and create it and look
at a miminal configuration::

    oebfare:
        dispatcher: "trac.main.web.dispatch_request"

That is the miminal amount of configuration needed to setup a WSGI process.
The configuration file is in the syntax of Yaml. This makes it drop dead
simple create processes and define parameters for each. The global key level
is where you define each WSGI process. You give it a name and its value is
multiple keys defining its parameters.

dispatcher
~~~~~~~~~~

This key is required. Its value is a Python module path to the WSGI callable
used to dispatch the request.
