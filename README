The versions numbers are not strict. They are simply the versions that were
used during testing.

.. _CherryPy WSGI server: http://www.cherrypy.org/browser/tags/cherrypy-3.1.0/cherrypy/wsgiserver/__init__.py?format=raw
.. _PyYaml: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML

Installation
============

Simply drop ``bosnowsgi.py`` on your ``PATH`` and ``chmod +x`` it.

Configuration
=============

Configuration of bosnowsgi is where its real power shines. You must create
yourself ``~/.bosnowsgirc`` file. This file is YAML that defines WSGI
processes at the top-level by name. Here is a quick example of a miminal
configuration file::

    oebfare:
        dispatcher: "trac.main.web.dispatch_request"

Parameters
----------

dispatcher
~~~~~~~~~~

This key is required. Its value is a Python module path to the WSGI callable
used to dispatch the request.

host
~~~~

Default: ``127.0.0.1``

The host on which the process should bind on.

port
~~~~

Default: ``None``

The port on which the process should listen to. ``port`` is optional at the
configuration file level. However, is required to run the server. If not
specified in the configuration, it must be given to the command-line.

Usage
=====

With the configuration all setup you are ready to manage WSGI processes. To
start the ``oebfare`` process execute::

    bosnowsgi.py oebfare start -p 9001

Parameters passed on the command-line will override any configuration of the
same kind.
